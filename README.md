# UFOs
## Overview 
In this web app, the user can review UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and/or shape of the UFO. This is meant as a resource for UFO enthusiasts & skeptics alike to review sightings.
## Results
In order to use this website, a user has two options: they can review the entire database of entries manually, or they can use the "filter search" capability to narrow down searches based on:
<ul>
  <li>Date</li>

</ul>
 More than one filter can be used to narrow down the entries, as well.
 
 ## Summary
 While this web app is clean and attractive, more emphasis should be put on the user experience, as the process is a bit clunky. Instead of an open form search for filters, a suggestion would be to have a dropdown list that dynamically adds options as data is added (i.e a triangular ship was spotted on 10-18-21 in Tucson, AZ, USA would pull out each detail). This would help the user have a more streamlined experience, as they wouldn't have to guess/hunt for their desired information. Also, allowance for variations in format (i.e us vs. USA) would make for an easier navigation experience as well.
